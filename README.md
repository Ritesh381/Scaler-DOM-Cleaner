# Scaler DOM Cleaner

A Chrome extension that cleans up the Scaler SST Dashboard by removing unwanted elements like referral banners, promotional cards, coins display, and other distracting UI components. This helps you focus on what matters - your learning! **Note:** The Mess Fee card is intentionally kept visible during the last 10 days of every month so you don't forget to fill out the mess form.
